This Java program simulates a basic E-commerce shopping system that allows users to register, login, view products, and manage their cart. This version includes improvements over the original version, such as product stock control, email-based registration, and login security.

âœ… Key Features Added
Product Stock Management
Each product now has a stock value. When a user adds a product to the cart, the stock reduces by 1. The user is prevented from adding a product if it is out of stock.

User Registration with Email
Users are now required to enter an email address during registration. This improves user identity and profile management.

Login Attempt Limit
A user is allowed only 3 attempts to enter correct credentials. If all attempts fail, the user is sent back to the main menu. This simulates basic account security.
